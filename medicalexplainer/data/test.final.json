hypercarbic respiratory failure: presents with dyspnea, but no clear cough or fevers. per report, patient felt like this with prior copd exacerbations. leukocytosis supports possible pneumonia, but history and cxr not entirely consistent with this. ekg with signs of demand, but romi negative. sputum gram stain unremarkable, but respitatory viral culture grew parainfluenze type 3 on [**7-24**]. patient was initially managed on solumedrol 60 mg iv q8h, and was eventually tapered. with no evidence of pneumonia on cxr and sputum gram stain, antibiotics were stopped [**7-25**]. beta-agonists and anticholinergics were continued around the clock. tte revealed mild symmetric lvh with normal ef, increased pcwp (>18mmhg), normal rv, and moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. on [**7-26**], bronchoscopy revealed collapsible, unremarkable airways. patient had difficulty weaning from the vent, and would become interimittenty hypertensive to sbp 200s and tachypnic to the 50s. patient was extubatied on [**7-27**] after passing sbt 0/5, but required re-intubation 30 minutes later for worsening secretions, lack of gag reflex, and tachypnea to the 50s. of note, on [**8-1**], the patient was found to have mrsa growing in sputum samples. although it was felt that this likely represented colonization as opposed to true infection, the patient was started on a course of vancomycin (which was stopped after 5 days). after multiple discussions between the patient's family and the icu team, the patient's pcp, [**name10 (nameis) **] the palliative care service, the patient's family ultimately decided that she would not want a tracheostomy. on [**2124-8-3**], extubation was pursued again and was successful. after extubation, her respiratory status improved and she was ultimately called out to the medical floor. on the floor she was progressively weaned to 2lnc with nebs (better than her baseline 5l @home). because of clinical exams revealing mild volume overload, she was intermittently diuresed. she also experienced intermittent shortness of breath with tachypnea but this was thought to be the result of attacks of anxiety with tachypnea. after receiving prn morphine, her breathing status would typically improve. a steroid taper was begun. the patient should continue prednisone 30 mg daily for 3 more days, then 20 mg daily for 4 days, then 10 mg daily for 4 days, then 5 mg daily for 4 days, then stop. # upper gi bleeding: on [**7-22**], patient had coffee grounds from og tube. lavage for approx 600ccs with clearance. gi perfomred egd which revealed esophagitis, ulcers and blood in the stomach body, d2 diverticulum and large hiatal hernia. h pylori was negative. patient was continued on iv ppi, with plan for repeat egd in 8 weeks, and upper gi series once clinically improved given abnormal anatomy on egd. her hematocrit remained stable with no further episodes of upper gi bleeding throughout the patient's hospitalization. on the floor she was switched to po pantoprazole twice daily. aspirin was held. # weakness: the patient was found to have generalized weakness at the end of her hospitalization. neurology was consulted and they felt it was likely due to a combination of steroid myopathy and deconditioning from her prolonged bedbound status. a tsh was checked which was normal. they recommended pulmonary and physical rehab. # cad: history of lad and rca stenosis on cath, but no stents. continued statin and beta blocker, but held aspirin for gi bleeding (see above). # nutrition: unable to pass ng without direct visualization due to hiatal hernia. ir guided post pyloric ng tube was placed on [**7-26**] for tfs and po medications. ng tube was pulled when patient was extubated on [**2124-8-3**]. speech and swallow were consulted following the patient's extubation and she was eventually moved to soft solids and thin liquids with 1:1 supervision. # goals of care: pcp [**last name (namepattern4) **]. [**last name (stitle) 1407**] was very involved in discussions regarding patient's code status. palliative care also followed along with the patient. ultimately, at the time of the patient's extubation on [**2124-8-3**], it was decided that the patient would be dnr/dni (although this was later change). the patient's family felt that she would not want a tracheostomy. it was decided that she would not be reintubated and that, if her respiratory status were to worsen after intubation, care would be focused on comfort. however, her status improved in the micu and on the floor and it was then decided that she would remain dnr with intubation (but no tracheostomy) if her breathing deteriorated. after several days with stable or improved overall clinical status, she was deemed suitable for rehabilitation. at the timem of discharge, the patient's code status was do not resuscitate, okay to intubate. medications on admission: # omeprazole 20 mg daily # furosemide 20 mg daily # toprol xl 50 mg daily # lipitor 20 mg daily # folic acid 1 mg daily # centrum daily # diovan 80 mg daily # trazodone 75-100 mg qhs # melatonin 3 mg qhs # [**doctor last name 1819**] aspirin 325 mg daily # albuterol neb prn # duoneb prn # advair 250/50 [**hospital1 **] # zolpidem 2.5 mg qhs prn # synthroid 100 mcg daily # lexapro 20 mg daily discharge medications: 1. metoprolol succinate 50 mg tablet sustained release 24 hr sig: one (1) tablet sustained release 24 hr po once a day. 2. atorvastatin 20 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily (daily). 3. folic acid 1 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily (daily). 4. multivitamin tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily (daily). 5. trazodone 50 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po at bedtime as needed for insomnia. 6. melatonin 3 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po at bedtime. 7. valsartan 160 mg tablet sig: 1.5 tablets po once a day. 8. albuterol sulfate 2.5 mg /3 ml (0.083 %) solution for nebulization sig: one (1) neb inhalation every 4-6 hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing. 9. duoneb 0.5 mg-3 mg(2.5 mg base)/3 ml solution for nebulization sig: one (1) neb inhalation every six (6) hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing. 10. fluticasone-salmeterol 250-50 mcg/dose disk with device sig: one (1) puff inhalation twice a day. 11. escitalopram 10 mg tablet sig: two (2) tablet po daily (daily). 12. levothyroxine 100 mcg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily (daily). 13. prednisone 20 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily () for 4 days: start after 3 days of 30 mg daily. 14. prednisone 10 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily () for 4 days: start after 4 days of 20 mg daily. 15. prednisone 5 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily () for 4 days: start after 4 days of 10 mg daily. 16. hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg capsule sig: one (1) capsule po daily (daily). 17. pantoprazole 40 mg tablet, delayed release (e.c.) sig: one (1) tablet, delayed release (e.c.) po twice a day. 18. morphine 10 mg/5 ml solution sig: five (5) mg po every four (4) hours as needed for respiratory discomfort: hold for oversedation or rr<12. 19. prednisone 10 mg tablet sig: three (3) tablet po once a day for 3 days. 20. colace 100 mg capsule sig: one (1) capsule po twice a day. 21. senna 8.6 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po twice a day as needed for constipation. 22. humalog insulin sliding scale please use attached humalog insulin sliding scale while on steroids. discharge disposition: extended care facility: [**location 1820**] center at [**location (un) 1821**] discharge diagnosis: primary: 1. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation 2. respiratory failure with intubation 3. upper gastrointestinal bleed/peptic ulcer disease 4. hypertension 5. anxiety secondary: 1. coronary artery disease 2. hypothyroidism discharge condition: mental status: confused -

brief-problem based hospital course is outlined below. 1) presumed c.diff infxn- admitted and started on p.o. vancomyin and iv metronidazole, w/ addition of levofloxacin for broad spectrum coverage given recent abd surgery. cholestyramine was initially given for toxin binding. wbc was 30 on admission and trended down with abx; however, c.diff toxin neg x5, so diagnosis remains presumptive. c. diff b toxin was sent and was negative as well. she completed a 3 week course of po vanco and iv flagyl antibiotics, which was completed on [**5-14**]. she subsequently remained afebrile without further diarrhea, and was able to tolerate po's. 2) [**name (ni) 1866**] pt began having episodes of brbpr on [**4-25**] with resultant slow hct drop. gi and surgery were consulted. pt had no abdominal pain, but given recent surgery and low albumin, we were concerned that the bleed may be evidence of ischemic bowel or dehiscence. pt was also having intermittent episodes of tachycardia, raising the possibility that she was having embolic phenomena with acute ischemia. however, she had no abdominal pain to suggest this. colonoscopy was done on [**4-30**], showing severe c dif vs. ischemic bowel. surgery found that pt was not surgical candidate and believed her bleeding and mucosal damage was [**2-29**] c dif and would continue to improve. biopsy results showed no evidence of c.dif, but given pt's tenuous status, po vanco and iv flagyl were continued while awaiting toxin b. it is quite possible that the mucosal changes seen on colonoscopy were the result of c dif infxn, which had been treated w/abx and resolved, leaving the mucosae to heal. as well, gi felt there may be a superimposed ischemic insult. no further work-up was performed since she had good clinical resolution of her colitis, following completion of cdiff treatment. 2) acute renal failure w/ cri- renal team was consulted on admisison. baseline cr is approx 2.0. on admission this was significantly elevated to 4.1. fena was c/w prerenal etiology and patient had r ij placed in ed, started on ns for volume resusciation. this was undertaken slowly given that pt had an albumin of 1.4 and pleural effusions were noted on ct. fluids were changed to 1/2ns w/ bicarb on hd2. cr trended down each day and the patient has maintained oxygenation. alb/cr ratio not c/w nephrotic range proteinuria- thus it was felt that the low alb was likely multifactorial. pt initially required boluses of 500cc ns to maintain uop ~20-30cc/hr. with hydration and improvement in her diarrhea, her cr steadily decreased and returned to baseline of 1.6. she was seen by renal who felt that her increase in creatinine may have been secondary to atn/hypotension and recommended avoiding aggressive overdiuresis. she did subsequently require aggressive diuresis given her rapid afib/chf with lasix and niseritide drips. however her creatinine remained at baseline of 1.7-2.0 with diuresis. she did develop a transient metabolic alkalosis, which was felt likely from volume contraction alkalosis. therefore her lasix was weaned to 40mg daily and her bicarb trended back down to 30. her creatinine was stable at 1.6 at the time of discharge. 3) [**name (ni) 1867**] pt was noted to be mildly thrombocytopenic on admisison. unclear why it was low when patient presented. most likely [**2-29**] extreme inflammatory/sirs response (given elev lactate on admission). her plt count dropped to 95 and dic workup and hit ab were sent, both negative. her plt count rose as her clinical condition improved and remained in normal range for the duration of her hosital course. 4) htn - pt's baseline sbp is in the 180s-200s range. on admission, bp was low [**2-29**] 3rd spacing and early sepsis. her bp responded to fluids and she remained relatively normotensive. she was continued on metoprolol for hr/bp control and isordil/hydral was added for afterload reduction. 5) chf - evidence of chf on initial cxr. her ef was found to be 40% (previously normal), bringing up concern for ischemic event precipitating her failure. in support of this she was noted to have wall motion abnormalities on echo with inferoseptal/basal hypokinesis. diagnostic catheritization was not performed due to her renal insufficiency and decompensated chf. she was managed medically, and on [**5-10**] the chf service was consulted for management. she was initiated on aggressive diuresis with iv lasix for goal -1.5l per day. she was transferred to the ccu briefly on [**5-12**] for more tailored therapy and diuresis for her chf (lasix boluses and nesiritide) with good effect (negative approximately 500 cc overnight). she was transferred back to the floor on lasix boluses. due to continued evidence of volume overload she was given 160mg iv [**month/year (2) 1868**] + started on lasix drip at 10mg/hr. then started nesiritide [**month/year (2) 1868**] (1mcg/kg) followed by gtt at 0.01mcg/kg/min. diuresed well to this and maintained bp well, however after increasing natrecor to 0.015, went back into rapid afib. stopped natrecor on [**5-17**]. stopped lasix gtt on [**5-18**] given persistent good diuresis. now tapered down to 40mg daily lasix/day + afterload reduction w/ isordil/hydral on [**5-22**]. at the time of discharge, she was felt to be euvolemic with goal of matching ins and outs daily. we will continue her on this regimen upon discharge. 7. atrial fibrillation: initially converted from raf by medical cardioversion performed with procainamide gtt in the ccu at 13mg/kg/hr x10min load followed by 2mg/hr for 2h trial. became hypotensive to 60's systolic, but subsequently recovered. then again went into raf on [**5-17**] early am. initially hr controlled w/ iv lopressor/iv dilt. then [**hospital 1869**] medical cardioversion w/ procainamide. became hypotensive to 70's systolic after about 10 minutes on procainamide [**last name (lf) 1868**], [**first name3 (lf) **] this was stopped and her blood pressures normalized. she then converted 10 min later to nsr. she has been in nsr the remainder of her hospital course. she is not on coumadin due to risk for bleed. in addition, amiodorone was discussed as a medical option for continued rythm control. however, given the side effect profile, the family and patient were more comfortable with holding off on adding amiodorone at this time. they understand that there is a higher risk of conversion back to atrial fibrillation and increased risk for stroke without amiodorone. we will continue rate control with metoprolol as mentioned at 25mg tid, and may titrate up as needed to maintain hr <80. 8. cad- wall motion abnormalities on echo w/ inferoseptal/basal hk. currently chest pain free. continuing with medical management. on statin/b-blocker. no plan for cath at this time given her renal insuff/co-morbiditites. also holding off on aspirin currently given her bleed risk. this will be re-addressed as an outpatient through her pcp [**last name (namepattern4) **]. [**last name (stitle) **]. 9. anemia- initially had episode of gi bleed with blood loss anemia requiring 3 units of packed red blood cells. hematocrit subsequently normalized. however, she subsequently was noted to have a low, but stable, hematocrit at 28-29. repeat stool guaiacs were all negative and she had no further evidence of bleed or hemolysis. iron stores were also found to be within normal limits, with low tibc and high ferritin suggesting anemia of chronic disease. this was felt likely secondary to chronic renal insufficiency. she was started on epo 2,000 units q m,w,fr on [**5-22**]. the goal transfusion criteria would be 30 given her history of cad, however, we have held off on further transfusion at this time given her known chf with recent severe volume overload. we have set transfusion goal at hct>28, and transfused with 1 unit packed red blood cells and 20mg iv lasix for hct <28. 10. tachypnea- resolved. her transient tachypnea was felt likely secondary to volume overload. there was no evidence of infiltrate by cxr. her abg at the time on [**5-15**] showed 7.29/43/99. her respiratory status subsequently improved that same day on [**5-15**] following iv lasix and atrovent nebulizers. avoided albuterol nebulizers over concern for tachycardia. 11. f/e/n- started on tpn for nutritional supplementation. she also had a swallow study which showed ability to tolerated regular solids and thin liquids. she has been taking in po's as tolerated, but has continued to require tpn to reach nutritional goals. this will be continued upon discharge at rehab. medications on admission: aspirin 81mg--one by mouth every day calcium --one tablet three times a day clonidine hcl 0.1 mg--4 tablet(s) by mouth twice a day colace 100mg--take one pill twice a day as needed for constipation lasix 20 mg--1 tablet(s) by mouth once a day lopressor 50mg--one half tablet by mouth twice a day nizoral 2%--use as directed norvasc 10mg--one by mouth every day phoslo 667mg--two tabs three times a day with meals per renal pletal 50mg--as per dr [**first name (stitle) 1870**] tylenol/codeine no.3 30-300mg--one tablet by mouth q 6 hours as needed for pain ultram 50mg--one half tablet by mouth twice a day as needed for leg pain vitamin d [**numeric identifier 1871**] unit--one tablet q week discharge medications: 1. acetaminophen 325 mg tablet sig: 1-2 tablets po q4-6h (every 4 to 6 hours) as needed for fever, pain. 2. brimonidine tartrate 0.15 % drops sig: one (1) drop ophthalmic q8h (every 8 hours). 3. miconazole nitrate 2 % powder sig: one (1) appl topical qid (4 times a day) as needed. 4. sodium chloride 0.65 % aerosol, spray sig: [**1-29**] sprays nasal qid (4 times a day) as needed for dry nasal mucosa. 5. albuterol sulfate 0.083 % solution sig: one (1) inhalation q3-4h () as needed. 6. ipratropium bromide 0.02 % solution sig: one (1) inhalation q6h (every 6 hours) as needed. 7. atorvastatin calcium 10 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily (daily). 8. timolol maleate 0.5 % drops sig: one (1) drop ophthalmic [**hospital1 **] (2 times a day). 9. loteprednol etabonate 0.5 % drops, suspension sig: one (1) ophthalmic daily (). 10. brinzolamide 1 % drops, suspension sig: one (1) ophthalmic [**hospital1 **] (2 times a day). 11. metoprolol tartrate 25 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po tid (3 times a day). 12. famotidine 20 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily (daily). 13. hydralazine hcl 25 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po tid (3 times a day). 14. isosorbide dinitrate 10 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po tid (3 times a day). 15. furosemide 40 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily (daily). 16. epoetin alfa 2,000 unit/ml solution sig: one (1) ml injection qmowefr (monday -wednesday-friday). discharge disposition: extended care facility: [**hospital3 7**] & rehab center - [**hospital1 8**] discharge diagnosis: 1. rapid atrial fibrillation 2. congestive heart failure (ef 40%) 3. hypotension 4. gastrointestinal bleed 5. coronary artery disease 6. refractory c.diff 7. non-healing surgical wound 8. deconditioning 9. malnutrition 10. contraction alkalosis 11. chronic renal insufficiency discharge condition: stable. discharge instructions: you are being discharged to [**hospital **] rehab. please follow-up with dr.

[**date range 1957**]: pt underwent r humerus orif and cervical laminectomy (report below), however pt post-op, the medicine service was consulted for hypoxia (pt required 50% shovel mask) and hypercarbia (pco2 in high 50's). she has a follow up appointment on [**3-18**] with [**month/year (2) **] to evaluate her fracture and decide whether her c-collar can be removed. hypoxia/hypercarbia: pt had hx of severe pulm htm, likely [**1-28**] pda. abg showed mild co2 retention? if this was close to her baseline. also likely had component of fluid overload, given recent surgery. pt was gently diuresed with iv lasix. narcotics were d/c'd as pt appeared somnolent. o2 was successfully weaned down to 2l nc (pt apparently had been on 2l o2 at home). cta on admission was negative for pe, and the suspicion for pe was fairly low post-op given that the pt was not tachycardic and her oxygen requirement improved. therefore, repeat cta was not done. she was also noted to be hypercarbic during admission, but her respiratory status remained stable while on the medicine service. status post fall: the original fall was of unclear etiology. the differential included vasovagal syncope versus new onset afib/atach versus mechanical given loss of consciousness. less likely include myocardial infarction/ischemia versus pulmonary embolism versus seizure. also less likely hypoglycemia given timing after meal although patinet on glyburide which is renally cleared in setting of increased creatinine. the patient ruled out for mi by cardiac enzymes, echo showed no obvious severe valvular disease to explain ?syncopal event, though telemetry showed periodic tachyarrhythmia ?sinus tach vs afib. she had no other significant tele events while in the hospital. elevated wbc and lactate at admission: unclear etiology, afebrile with negative ua and infectious workup at admission. this cleared on its own. later in hospitalization ([**2-27**]) she had a uti treated with course of ciprofloxacin. urine cxlood cx, and cath tip cx were sent prior to d/c to workup somnolence, however pt's somnolence cleared and cx's were pending on d/c. these should be followed at her follow up appointments. musculoskeletal: initially, radiographic imaging was negative for fracture or bleed including right ue, hips bilaterally, c-spine and head. patient with known chronic low back pain and sciatica. hypertension/pulmonary hypertension: continued asa, held valsartan. lasix initially held for renal failure but was restarted once she was clinically stable. hypercholesterolemia: continued home dose of lipitor. renal: she has slight renal insufficiency at admission and was given gentle ivf. her electrolytes were followed and repleted as needed, mvi and continued niferex. arf improved. she should have her potassium and bun/creatinine followed at regular intervals starting 2-3 days post discharge, as she was discharged on her home dose of [**last name (un) **] and new dose of lasix. prophylaxis: the patient was maintained on teds, sq heparin, ppi, bowel regimen. she complained of rle pain one day, and u/s was ordered to r/o dvt - this study was negative. communication: son [**telephone/fax (1) 1958**] [**last name (un) 1959**]. operative report [**last name (lf) 1960**],[**first name3 (lf) **] t. signed electronically by [**last name (lf) 1960**],[**first name3 (lf) **] on [**doctor first name **] [**2134-3-4**] 1:18 pm name: [**known lastname 1961**], [**known firstname 1962**] unit no: [**numeric identifier 1963**] service: nme date: [**2134-3-2**] surgeon: [**first name8 (namepattern2) **] [**last name (namepattern1) **], m.d.

negative b-d-glucan - negative cdiff - negative bcx - pending brief hospital course: ms. [**known lastname 14**] is a 61 yo w/ stage ii breast cancer who was admitted on day 13 or cycle 2 of docetaxel (taxotere) + cyclophosphomide who developed fever to 100.6 at home with associated rigors in the setting of neutropenia. #neutropenic fever- on presentation the pt's pmn count was 21 most likely from her most recent chemotherapy cycle and lack of neulasta use. two possible sources of infection existed including pulmonary or from a laceration on her finger suffered while gardening. she was broadly covered with vancomycin and cefepime to cover both possible sources, as well as flagyl to cover for cdiff as the patient mentioned that she had increased ostomy output. when cdiff returned negative, flagyl was discontinued. blood cultures were sent and a u/a was not concerning for infection. we also sent off galactomannan antigen and beta-d-glucan labs initially as part of her neutropenic fever workup which were negative. the following day after admission her wbc rose significantly and she no longer was neutropenic. as her wbc rose she started to develope a cough and he cxr became concerning for an infiltrate. she was continued on vanc/cefepime until afebrile and with anc>1000 for greater than 48 hours, after which she was switched to po levofloxacin to complete an 8 day total course for community acquired pneumonia. # hypotension- in the [**name (ni) **] pt's sbp dropped to 70s, not responding to ivf boluses. she refused central line placement in the ed and peripheral pressors were initiated. this is most likely related to her underlying infectious process. she was not administered any medications recently that could be accounting for her hypotension. looking through omr her baseline blood pressures are sbp of 90s-100s. an a-line was obtained which showed higher bp than what was being recorded by the blood pressure cuff. she was given several liters of iv fluid boluses and weaned off pressors the night of admission to the icu. her cuff and a-line pressures correlated after fluid resuscitation and the a-line was discontinued. # breast cancer- currently in cycle 2 of docetaxel (taxotere) + cyclophosphomide. most likely this current episode of neutropenia is due to the fact that neulasta was not given during this cycle of chemo per pt's request, however due to the rapid rise in her wbc count myelosuppression from sepsis was also a possibility. # depression / anxiety- continue duloxetine and clonazepam at home doses. # nausea- continued compazine and po zofran prn. medications on admission: clonazepam -

without improvement. he was subsequently changed to daptomycin, ciprofloxicin and flagyl with some improvement. due to the addition of broad spectrum antibiotics his oral vancomycin was increased to

loculated r pleural effusion, interventional pulmonary consulted who did ultrasound, determined effusion to mostly be subdiagphragmatic? loculated, and that risks outweighted benefits of thoracocentesis in pt with thrombocytopenia, small pleural effusion, and acutely ill. placed on vancomycin and meropenem for treatment of pna. towards the end of hospital course, pt became increasingly wheezy on exam, placed on albuterol/atrovent nebs. suctioned for aspiration risk. 3) anemia / thrombocytopenia: ddx initially included hit, ttp, dic. hit ab was negative. anemia labs consistent with anemia of chronic disease. there was no evidence of acute hemolysis, and thrombocytopenia was attributed to chronic dic vs undiagnosed myelodysplastic syndrome or prostate cancer infiltrating bone marrow per hematology. he continued to require multiple transfusions of prbcs to maintain hct > 25. 4) metastatic prostate cancer: repeat bone scan showed increasing metastatic disease. ruq u/s significant for multiple liver lesions suspicious for malginancy. he was followed by oncology service, but was not treated for his malignancy. had hypercalemia during hospital course, likely secondary to bone mets, given pamidronate 90 mg iv. 5) elevated lfts: during last week of hospital course, it was noted that pt's lfts trended upwards. ruq u/s significant for acute cholecystitis, could not r/o acute cholangitis. he was started on flagyl, already on vancomycin and meropenem for pna as above. he never had fevers, unclear if ams at this point [**1-10**] to acute cholangitis or some other infectious/metabolic insult. it was also thought that masses seen in liver coudl possibly be abscesses; however pt never stable enough to go down to radiology for further imaging. became severely jaundiced during last few days of hospital course, lfts indicative of obstructive jaundice. 6) total body anasarca: pt with low albumin, low hct leading to decreased oncotic pressure and was likely 3rd spacing. given mulitple prbc transfusions c lasix c slight improvement. placed on tpn for nutrional needs. 7) arf: on admission, thought to be prerenal initially in setting of decreased po intake but fena on admission was >1%, raising concern for intrarenal process, atn vs ttp vs ain. creat now improved to 1.1 after hydration. during last few days of hospital course, pt again with rising cr above baseline and arf. fe urea < 35%, indicative of prerenal causes, likely secondary to intravasuclar depletion from third spacing. vancomycin was dosed by trough < 15. lasix was held given arf, dosed carefully by i/os and cardiopulmonary exam. on last hospital day, it was noted pt was not making good urine, 100 cc over 6 hrs. he was bolused c ns without much improvement in urine output. 8) labile bps / pain: pain likely a component of pt's elevated bps; however remains unclear what was exactly causing htn. he was not placed on an antihypertensive during hospital course, responded to morphine iv. 9) hypernatremia: pt c hypernatremia during hospital course. free water placement initiated with improvement. 10) hypercalcemia: pt c hypercalcemia during hospital course, likely secondary to metastatic bone disease. ivf and pamidronate given c improvement. 11) mastoiditis/sphenoid sinusitis: placed on flagyl x 3 days for treatment of mastoiditis/sphenoid sinusitis. ngt was d/c'd and nasal saline spray was initiated as per ent. 12) t12 compression fracture - with retropulsed bone fragments extending to and narrowing the spinal canal. neurology and neurosurgery were called, stated that lesion was stable, and given pt's lack of mobility and risks > benefits of operating, no need for further intervention. 13) h/o etoh: mvi, folate, thiamine repleted during hospital course. vit b12 and folate wnl on lab studies. 14) fen: an ng tube was placed and tubefeed initiated when pt c ams s/p seizure. electrolytes were repleted as needed. hypernatremia and hypercalcemia treated appropriately. ngt was d/c'd upon diagnosis of mastoiditis as per ent, peg placement discussed c gi and nutrition, risks determined to outweight benefits of peg in pt due to active infection, thrombocytopenia. the pt had picc line placed and tpn was initiated. 15) communication: patient was estranged from only daughter, no health care proxy. contact number for niece in chart disconnected. no other family contact info from availabe from nursing home. guardianship was under process by hospital legal services. when [**hospital **] medical status deteroirated, ethics (dr [**first name (stitle) 9305**] consulted. togehter, dr.

now with severe refractory right hip pain related to a right femur met. #. right hip/back pain. the patient has a known right femur met that is the likely cause of his pain. he was scheduled to have an orthopedic procedure as an outpatient on [**6-7**] to help stabilize the femur with the goal of helping to improve his pain; however, his pain became too much to bear at home on his oral pain regimen and he required admission for iv pain control. he was recently admitted from [**date range (1) 27916**] for pain control related to this same pain in his right leg/back which required dilaudid pca. this admission, his dilaudid pca was titrated up to 0.5mg q6 minutes, but mental status changes were noted and he was titrated back to 0.37mg q6 minutes. the ortho/oncology service was consulted and recommended right femur plain films which ruled out pathologic fracture. he was taken to the or on [**6-8**] for intramedullary nail to stabilize his femur with a goal of improving pain and preventing pathologic fracture. his post-op course was complicated by delirium in the pacu secondary to poor pain control which required a brief icu stay. he was started on a dilaudid drip in the icu and his delirium quickly resolved. he was then transitioned from a dilaudid drip back to dilaudid pca at 0.37mg q6min and then to 4-8mg of po dilaudid q3 hours prn. lovenox 40 mg sc qd was started for dvt ppx starting [**6-9**] which was one day post-op. he was continued on his home oxycontin 140mg tid and baclofen 5-10mg prn spasms. his home anagrelide for essential thrombocytosis was held during his hospitalization for pre- and post-op prevention of bleeding, but the surgery service recommended restarting it on day of discharge. he will need to remain on anagerlide given his high risk for clot with essential thrombocytosis. pt was also on lovenox for dvt ppx, which needs to be continued for 1 month post-op. pt's pain regimen was ultimately titrated up to oxycontin 180mg tid plus dilaudid 12-20mg q4h prn which gave adequate control, ensuring that the pt does not require any iv dilaudid. pt was also given bowel regimen. #. htn. the patient's verpamil was uptitrated to 240mg daily during his last admission. his blood pressure remained elevated up to 190s systolic likely secondary to acute pain. he was continued on verapamil 240mg daily and hydralazine 25mg was administered q6 prn for bp>180 as the patient had an allergy documented to labetalol. pt was also started on lisinopril 10mg daily for better bp control. #. leukocytosis. likely due to stress reaction from acute pain as patient has no signs of underlying infection. he also has essential thrombocytosis which is associated with increased wbc counts in situations of inflammatory stress. blood and urine cultures remained negative and several cxrs showed no evidence of pneumonia. no antibiotics were initiated. #. diabetes. continued home iss and glargine. #. hyperlipidemia. continued home simvastatin. #. depression. continued home citalopram. #. pt was on a regular diet, on lovenox for dvt ppx. pt was full code. medications on admission: -verapamil 240mg po qam -agrylin 3mg qam and 4mg

which could be a developing pneumonia. extremely subtle increase in density is seen adjacent to the right hilar region, which could relate to early pulmonary edema. however, the pulmonary vascular markings are not significantly distended. right effusion is again demonstrated. impression: new airspace finding in the left upper lung zone, possibly in the right mid lung zone. continued followup is recommended. abdominal a-gram: impression: 1. nonselective aortography and selective superior mesenteric artery arteriogram demonstrate no evidence of active gastrointestinal bleeding. diffuse atheromatous disease was noted. 2. selective catheterization of the inferior mesenteric artery was unsuccessful, likely due to severe atherosclerotic disease at its origin as shown on a previous ct scan. 3. endoscopy recommended to better clarify origin of bleeding. ct head: impression: no acute intracranial hemorrhage or change from the prior examination. mr [**name13 (stitle) **]: impression: no definite evidence of osteomyelitis of the sacrum. subtle increased signal within the coccyx could be secondary to partial volume averaging from the adjacent decubitus ulcer. moderate spinal stenosis at l4-5 level. brief hospital course: 66f with chronic trach and peg, s/p cva in [**2130**] with residual weakness who presents from home with lethargy and hypotension. # sepsis: on admission, wbc elevated to 23 with 8% bands and lactate of 4.4. patient with hx of c diff, serratia and mrsa bacteremia in the past. during a previous admission, pt had mrsa bacteremia but no source was identified. no hx of diarrhea. blood, sputum cultures sent. pt is anuric so no urine culture. patient however with multiple sources of infection, including sacral decub ulcers, dry gangrene in both feet, tracheostomy and g-tube insertion sites. pt sx's initially improved dramatically with supportive therapy. cultures returned pseudomonas from sputum and begun on meropenem on [**7-28**]. ct + mri of sacral and posterior-tibial decubs showed no evidence of osteomyelitis. patient initially failed [**last name (un) 104**]-stim test and completed a five day course of stress dose steroids. regarding sacral decub ulcers, plastics was consulted and did not feel there was any role for surgical intervention. during admission, patient with multiple positive cultures including the following: sputum on [**2132-7-28**] growing pseudomonas and gnr; sputum on [**2132-8-11**], [**2132-8-15**], [**2132-8-20**] growing pseudomonas and gnr; sacral decubitus ulcer swab on [**2132-8-21**] growing

enterococcus faecium (vre but sensitive to linezolid). patient has been treated with tobramycin and zosyn for double coverage of pseudomonas in sacral decubitus ulcers, linezolid for mrsa and vre, and levofloxacin for chronic aortic abscess with serratia. patient's hd catheter was removed when patient was found to have vre. patient also with hx of aortic annular abscess with serratia and? of endocarditis at [**location (un) 5871**] and is chronically treated with levoquin. vasc [**doctor first name **] performed a partial amp/debridement of the l great toe in the setting of dry gangrene. wound cultures from the tissue returned pseudomonas as well which showed resistance to meropenem. vasc surgery recommended amputation with bka due to gangrneous toes bilaterally. family refused intervention. pt had a recurrent episode of vre in her blood and a pna with psuedomonas and klesiella. this was again treated with meropenem and amikacin for a 14 day course. she was also started on daptomycin for recurrent vre in her blood for a 14 day course. # lethargy: patient with lethargy throughout her course, likely secondary to patient's sepsis. head ct was negative for any intracranial hemorrhage or mass. this improved and pt was at her baseline at time of discharge. # resp: s/p trach, on vent at home with settings of assist control 450x22xpeep of 5x60%. pt. remained mostly on home vent settings throughout hospital stay. oxygenating well on fio2 of 60%. she had her peep increased to 8 [**2-21**] increased pleural effusions due to volume resuscitation during bouts of sepsis/gi bleed. also, during her acute gi bleed, her rate was increased to help offset a lactic acidosis that occured [**2-21**] the large amounts of blood products she received. other than this her vent settings have remained stable. will likely be able to decrease her fio2 over time after her pneumonia completely resolves. trach is 7.0 extra long shiley. # cv: ** ischemia: ekg nml ** rhythm: paf; on dilt for rate control. continue amio and digoxin. pt was taken off all anticoagulation due to recurrent gi bleeding. cardiology consulted for risk of no anticoag with mechanical valve. risk of thrombus is approx 10% per year, however pt had large gi bleed on any anticoagulation. due to liver failure, pts inr has remained elevated to 2.0 throughout admission. ** pump: ef 55% on [**2130**] echo, diastolic dysfxn. # esrd on hd: during this admission, patient was initially on hemodialysis and was converted for a short time to cvvhd. however, once patient's renal function and hemodynamics became more stable, patient should be continued on hemodialysis per home regimen. # anemia: baseline hct of 29-30. during this admission, patient became supratherapeutic on coumadin and heparin and developed increased bleeding, including vaginal bleeding, skin tears, and sacral ulcers. pelvic us demonstrated thickened endometrial stripe. ob-gyn was consulted and did not suggest further work-up given that patient was unlikely to receive any further treatment. patient's coumadin and heparin drip have been held while concern for active bleeding. pt then had active gi bleeding and all anticoag has been held for recurrent gib while on anticoagulation. # gib: pt had bright red blood per ostomy and gi service was consulted. pt found to have petecial lesion in residual colon, no active bleeding. egd was negative. attempted to restart anticoagulation however pt continued to have gib when on heparin. on one occasion, a bleeding vessel was found at the stomal site and a stitch was placed by surgery, with no recurrent bleeding from that vessel. decision made with gi and cardiology to hold anticoagulation. # lactic acidosis: pt was found to be hypotensive to the 50s-60s several times during her hospital course. an arterial line was placed for better monitoring and revealed a difference in cuff pressure of 30 points. lactate was elevated to 10, which was attributed to linezolid. this was discontinued and she was started on daptomycin for vre bacteremia. she should not receive linezolid again and it was added to her allergy list. # dm: patient with very poorly controlled blood glucose at home. patient's blood glucose was managed during this hospitalization with the help of [**last name (un) **]. she was placed on an insulin drip during her intermittent sepsis, as her sugars were difficult to control. prior to discharge, her insulin regimen was transitioned to glargine at 7 untis qam and an agressive insulin sliding scale. # thrombocytopenia: pt had progressive thrombocytopenia throughout admission. hep ab neg. felt to be 2/2 pts extensive medical illnesses and broad spectrum abx. no furhter intervention at this time. dic labs normal. pt did not require plt transfusion. team was notified after patient was discharged that heparin dependent antibody sent on [**10-25**] had come back as positive. case management was notified to let the patient's dialysis service and home nursing agency know that the patient should not receive heparin in any form. # wound care: pt has large sacral decub and multiple skin tears [**2-21**] skin breakdown. wound care followed throughout admission. # social: multiple family meetings were held with medical, nursing, social work, case management, gi and renal consultants throughout this admission where the medical staff made it clear to the family that the patient is dying and that we would recommend comfort measures at this point. the health care proxy refused to convert care to comfort and wanted to continue with aggressive measures. ethics and palliative care consulted during this admission and fmaily refused to talk to them. # code: already intubated, no shocks, no compressions. dnr.
